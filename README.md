# Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with GAN

For this project I was inspired by the paper [Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Traffic Light](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12339).

## Usage
Running the code is very simple: you have to download the 'project' folder and run the file 'train.py' if you want to train the model or 'evaluate.py' if you want to evaluate it.
